# CPP Module 08

## ex00
The function template “easyfind” accepts a type T and takes two parameters. <br>
The first one has type T and the second one is an integer. Assuming T is a container of integers, this function finds the first occurrence of the second parameter in the first parameter. <br>
If no occurrence is found, the program throws an exception. <br> <br>

## ex01
Span is about developing a Span class that can store a maximum of N integers. It then finds out the shortest and the longest span between all the numbers stored. <br>
If there are already N elements stored a new one cannot be added and an exception gets thrown. <br>
If there are no numbers stored, or only one, no span can be found. Thus, an exception gets thrown. <br> <br>
